AuditDapps
Framework-Backed • AI-Enhanced • Research-Based Blockchain Security Auditing

AuditDapps is a blockchain security SaaS platform that empowers developers, startups, and enterprises to self-audit decentralized applications (dApps) using globally recognized industry frameworks — ISO 27001, NIST, CIS Controls, OWASP, and blockchain-specific security controls.
In this context, “dApps” include NFTs, DeFi platforms, tokens, or tokenless applications on any blockchain or decentralized ledger.

Built on deep research in cybersecurity, human factors, and secure systems design, AuditDapps combines AI-driven insights with academically validated, standards-based methodologies to deliver a trusted, human-centric audit experience.

AuditDapps Self-Audit
Our flagship self-audit tool enables Web3 developers, startups, and organizations to identify vulnerabilities and security gaps before deploying smart contracts or launching dApps.
